The repo is a personal collection of projects related to quantitative research and systematic investing.

ðŸ“… The structure is organized by month. Within each month, there are different projects covering a range of topics â€” including data ingestion, feature engineering, signal research, validation, and other areas I'm exploring.

ðŸ§ª Most of the work here is experimental or in-progress. The goal is to learn, test ideas, and keep improving over time.
