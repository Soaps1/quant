# ðŸ§® Monty Python Problem Probability Calculator

This project contains a script that calculates the probability of winning the classic Monty Python problem with **n doors**. In this variation, the host opens **n-2 doors** after your initial choice, and you can decide whether to stick or switch.

## Classic Setup

- There are **n doors**.
- Behind one door is a prize; the others are empty.
- You pick one door.
- The host, who knows where the prize is, opens **n-2 doors** that do **not** have the prize.
- You are given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.

## What This Script Does

- **Input:** Number of doors (**n**).
- **Output:** Probability of winning if you switch or stick, given the host opens **n-2 doors**.
